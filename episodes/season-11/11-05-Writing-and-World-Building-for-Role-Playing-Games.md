# 11.05: Writing and World Building for Role Playing Games 

Listen [here](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2016/01/31/11-05-writing-and-world-building-for-role-playing-games/). 

**Prompt:** Write about a non-player, non-heroic character (say, the NPC who cleans the alley behind the tavern) in your setting. What do they want? What do they fear? What do they love? How might their story play out independently from the story told by the players?
