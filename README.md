## What is Writing Excuses?

In the words of its hosts:

> Writing Excuses is a fast-paced, educational podcast for writers, by writers. It airs weekly, with new episodes appearing each Sunday evening at around 6pm Eastern Time. Episodes vary in length from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, but are usually less than twenty minutes long. The tagline, “Fifteen minutes long, because you’re in a hurry, and we’re not that smart” isn’t super accurate, time-wise, but it’s a haiku so we’re keeping it.

Since Season 7 _Writing Excuses_ podcasts have ended with a prompt: a fun, short exercise that builds on topics discussed during the cast. This repository contains all the prompts published to date.

* [Season 12](/indeces/season-12.md)
* [Season 11](/indeces/season-11.md)
* [Season 10](/indeces/season-10.md)

## Why create a GitHub Repo?

To make it easy to respond to all the prompts in an orderly fashion. I will checkout a branch in my name and put all my answers in it. Feel free to check out your own branch and do the same.

If you want to clone the repo and run the scraper yourself...

```bash
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 excuse
source excuse/bin/activate
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Assuming you're running OSX.
