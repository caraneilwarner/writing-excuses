## What is Writing Excuses?

In the words of its hosts: 

> Writing Excuses is a fast-paced, educational podcast for writers, by writers. It airs weekly, with new episodes appearing each Sunday evening at around 6pm Eastern Time. Episodes vary in length from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, but are usually less than twenty minutes long. The tagline, “Fifteen minutes long, because you’re in a hurry, and we’re not that smart” isn’t super accurate, time-wise, but it’s a haiku so we’re keeping it.

Since Season 7 _Writing Excuses_ podcasts have ended with a prompt: a fun, short exercise that builds on topics discussed during the cast. This repository contains all the prompts published to date.

* [Season 12](/season-12.md)
* [Season 11](/season-11.md)
* [Season 10](/season-10.md)
* [Season 9](/season-09.md)
* [Season 8](/season-08.md)
* [Season 7](/season-07.md)

## Why create a GitHub Repo?

To make it easy to respond to all the prompts in an orderly fashion. I'll be responding to prompts a season at a time via PRs like [this one](https://github.com/carawarner/writing-excuses/pull/1). I won't merge that PR, however, because I want the repo to stay forkable. Feel free to fork it and add your responses straight into your copy of the repo.
