# What is Writing Excuses?

In the words of its hosts: 

> Writing Excuses is a fast-paced, educational podcast for writers, by writers. It airs weekly, with new episodes appearing each Sunday evening at around 6pm Eastern Time. Episodes vary in length from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, but are usually less than twenty minutes long. The tagline, “Fifteen minutes long, because you’re in a hurry, and we’re not that smart” isn’t super accurate, time-wise, but it’s a haiku so we’re keeping it.

# Why create a GitHub Repo?

Since Season 7 _Writing Excuses_ podcasts have ended with a prompt: a fun, short exercise that builds on topics discussed during the cast. This repository contains all the prompts published to date. I created it so I could answer them in an orderly fashion. Feel free to [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and add your responses straight into the .md files for each episode. The .md files include links to the associated podcast and the text of the writing prompt.
